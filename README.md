TODO - needs to run a migration for postgresql

- technology: Prisma, NestJS, PostgreSQL, SvelteKit, tRPC
- encountered challenge to transfer data back to the frontend: trpc doesnt regonize the entity class for the database -> return or procedure was always 'any' so DTOs were needed as type declarations
